Formulas:
PCI sent = RSMI_PCI_THROUGHPUT_SENT
PCI received = RSMI_PCI_THROUGHPUT_RECEIVED
PCI send bandwidth = 1E-6*RSMI_PCI_THROUGHPUT_SENT/runtime
PCI recv bandwidth = 1E-6*RSMI_PCI_THROUGHPUT_RECEIVED/runtime
--
Currently not usable since the RSMI_PCI_THROUGHPUT_* events require
one second per call, so 2 seconds for both of them.
