Formulas:
Used cycles ratio [%] = 100*UOPS_EXECUTED_USED_CYCLES/CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE
Unused cycles ratio [%] = 100*UOPS_EXECUTED_STALL_CYCLES/CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE
Avg stall duration [cycles] = UOPS_EXECUTED_STALL_CYCLES/UOPS_EXECUTED_STALL_CYCLES:EDGEDETECT
-
This performance group returns the ratios of used and unused cycles regarding
the execution stage in the pipeline. Used cycles are all cycles where uOPs are
executed while unused cycles refer to pipeline stalls. Moreover, the group
calculates the average stall duration in cycles.
