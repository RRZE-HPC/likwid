Getting Power and Energy from PMC counters (core: per raw count is 8 nJ; L2: per raw count
is 32 nJ; and HBM: per count is 256 nJ). On 24-core/2.6GHz A64FX the former two values
change to 9 nJ and 36 nJ, respectively. The Likwid internals will scale counters appropriately
and the output lists adjusted counters which are shown in nJ.
