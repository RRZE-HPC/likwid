Formulas:
L1 DTLB request rate =  L1D_ALL_CACHE_REF / INSTR_RETIRED_ANY
DTLB miss rate  = DTLB_MISSES_ANY / INSTR_RETIRED_ANY
L1 DTLB miss ratio  =  DTLB_MISSES_ANY / L1D_ALL_CACHE_REF
-
L1 DTLB request  rate tells you how data intensive your code is
or how many Data accesses you have in average per instruction.
The DTLB miss  rate gives a measure how often a TLB miss occured
per instruction. And finally L1 DTLB  miss ratio tells you how many
of your memory references required caused a TLB miss in average.
