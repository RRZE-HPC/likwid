METRICS
Runtime (RDTSC) [s] time
Runtime unhalted [s] FIXC1*inverseClock
Clock [MHz]  1.E-06*(FIXC1/FIXC2)/inverseClock
CPI  PMC1/PMC0
Memory bandwidth [MBytes/s] 1.0E-06*(DFC0+DFC1)*64.0/time
Memory data volume [GBytes] 1.0E-09*(DFC0+DFC1)*64.0

LONG
Formulas:
Memory bandwidth [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*(DRAM_CHANNEL_0+DRAM_CHANNEL_1)*64.0/runtime
Memory data volume [GBytes] = 1.0E-09*(DRAM_CHANNEL_0+DRAM_CHANNEL_1)*64.0
-
Profiling group to measure memory bandwidth drawn by all cores of a socket.
Since this group is based on Uncore events it is only possible to measure on a
per socket base.
The group provides almost accurate results for the total bandwidth and data volume.
AMD describes this metric as "approximate" in the documentation for AMD Rome.
