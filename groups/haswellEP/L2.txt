Formulas:
L2D load bandwidth [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*L1D_REPLACEMENT*64.0/time
L2D load data volume [GBytes] = 1.0E-09*L1D_REPLACEMENT*64.0
L2D evict bandwidth [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*L2_TRANS_L1D_WB*64.0/time
L2D evict data volume [GBytes] = 1.0E-09*L2_TRANS_L1D_WB*64.0
L2 bandwidth [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*(L1D_REPLACEMENT+L2_TRANS_L1D_WB+ICACHE_MISSES)*64/time
L2 data volume [GBytes] = 1.0E-09*(L1D_REPLACEMENT+L2_TRANS_L1D_WB+ICACHE_MISSES)*64
-
Profiling group to measure L2 cache bandwidth. The bandwidth is computed by the
number of cacheline allocated in the L1 and the number of modified cachelines
evicted from the L1. The group also output total data volume transfered between
L2 and L1. Note that this bandwidth also includes data transfers due to a write
allocate load on a store miss in L1 and traffic caused by misses in the
L1 instruction cache.
