Formula:
Issued UOPs = UOPS_ISSUED_ANY
Executed UOPs = UOPS_EXECUTED_THREAD
Retired UOPs = UOPS_RETIRED_ANY
-
This performance group measures the UOP execution through the different units
in the CPUs pipeline. At first the instructions are decoded (no event) before
they are issued to the reservation station. When all data for the execution of
the UOP is available, the UOP is executed by one of the six dispatch ports.
After execution, the UOP is queued in the reorder buffer in order to wait until
the retirement of all other UOPs that formed the original instruction. When all
UOPs are retired, the instruction is marked as retired.
