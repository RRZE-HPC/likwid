Formulas:
L3 request rate = L3_CACHE_REQ/RETIRED_INSTRUCTIONS
L3 miss rate = L3_CACHE_REQ_MISS/RETIRED_INSTRUCTIONS
L3 miss ratio = L3_CACHE_REQ_MISS/L3_CACHE_REQ

This group measures the locality of your data accesses with regard to the
L3 cache. L3 request rate tells you how data intensive your code is
or how many data accesses you have on average per instruction.
The L3 miss rate gives a measure how often it was necessary to get
cache lines from memory. And finally L3 miss ratio tells you how many of your
memory references required a cache line to be loaded from a higher level.
While the data cache miss rate might be given by your algorithm you should
try to get data cache miss ratio as low as possible by increasing your cache reuse.
AMD defines two events for L3 cache misses:
- The performance metrics table uses L3_CACHE_REQ_MISS (0x0300C00000400104)
- The official event for L3 misses is L3_MISS_REQ (0x0300C00000401F9a)
