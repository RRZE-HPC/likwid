METRICS
Runtime (RDTSC) [s] time
Runtime unhalted [s]   FIXC1*inverseClock
Clock [MHz]  1.E-06*(FIXC1/FIXC2)/inverseClock
CPI   PMC1/PMC0
Energy Core [J]  PWR0
Power Core [W] PWR0/time
Energy L3 [J]  PWR2
Power L3 [W] PWR2/time

LONG
Formulas:
Power Core [W] = RAPL_CORE_ENERGY/time
Power L3 [W] = RAPL_L3_ENERGY/time
-
Ryzen implements the RAPL interface previously introduced by Intel.
This interface enables to monitor the consumed energy on the core and L3
domain.
It is not documented by AMD which parts of the CPU are in which domain.
