Formulas:
Power Core [W] = RAPL_CORE_ENERGY/time
Power PKG [W] = RAPL_PKG_ENERGY/time
Power DRAM [W] = RAPL_DRAM_ENERGY/time
-
Ryzen implements the RAPL interface previously introduced by Intel.
This interface enables to monitor the consumed energy on the core and package
domain.
It is not documented by AMD which parts of the CPU are in which domain.
