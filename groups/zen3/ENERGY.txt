Runtime (RDTSC) [s] time
Runtime unhalted [s]   FIXC1*inverseClock
Clock [MHz]  1.E-06*(FIXC1/FIXC2)/inverseClock
CPI   PMC1/PMC0

Formulas:
Power Core [W] = RAPL_CORE_ENERGY/time
Power PKG [W] = RAPL_PKG_ENERGY/time
-
Ryzen implements the RAPL interface previously introduced by Intel.
This interface enables to monitor the consumed energy on the core and package
domain.
It is not documented by AMD which parts of the CPU are in which domain.
