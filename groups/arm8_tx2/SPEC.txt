LONG
Formulas:
Load ops spec. ratio = LD_SPEC / INST_SPEC
Store ops spec. ratio = ST_SPEC / INST_SPEC
Integer data ops spec. ratio = DP_SPEC / INST_SPEC
Scalar FP ops spec. ratio = VFP_SPEC / INST_SPEC
Vector FP ops spec. ratio = ASE_SPEC / INST_SPEC
Other ops spec. ratio = (INST_SPEC-LD_SPEC-ST_SPEC-DP_SPEC-VFP_SPEC-ASE_SPEC) / INST_SPEC
-
This group gives information about the speculative execution of micro-ops.
It is currently unclear why Other ops spec. executed and ratio is negative
in some cases. Although the documentation contains an OP_RETIRED, there is no
equivalent OP_SPEC which could be a better reference in this group instead of
INST_SPEC.
