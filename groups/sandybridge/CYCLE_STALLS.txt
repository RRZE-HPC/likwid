Total execution stalls = CYCLE_ACTIVITY_STALLS_TOTAL
Stalls caused by L1D misses [%] = (CYCLE_ACTIVITY_STALLS_L1D_PENDING/CYCLE_ACTIVITY_STALLS_TOTAL)*100
Stalls caused by L2 misses [%] = (CYCLE_ACTIVITY_STALLS_L2_PENDING/CYCLE_ACTIVITY_STALLS_TOTAL)*100
Execution stall rate [%] = (CYCLE_ACTIVITY_STALLS_TOTAL/CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE)*100
Stalls caused by L1D misses rate [%] = (CYCLE_ACTIVITY_STALLS_L1D_PENDING/CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE)*100
Stalls caused by L2 misses rate [%] = (CYCLE_ACTIVITY_STALLS_L2_PENDING/CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE)*100
--
This performance group measures the stalls caused by data traffic in the cache
hierarchy.
CYCLE_ACTIVITY_STALLS_TOTAL: Total execution stalls.
CYCLE_ACTIVITY_STALLS_L1D_PENDING: Execution stalls while L1 cache miss demand
load is outstanding.
CYCLE_ACTIVITY_STALLS_L2_PENDING: Execution stalls while L2 cache miss demand
load is outstanding.
