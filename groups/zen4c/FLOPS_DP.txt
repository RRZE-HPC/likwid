METRICS
Runtime (RDTSC) [s] time
Runtime unhalted [s]   FIXC1*inverseClock
Clock [MHz]  1.E-06*(FIXC1/FIXC2)/inverseClock
CPI   PMC1/PMC0

Formulas:
CPI = CPU_CLOCKS_UNHALTED/RETIRED_INSTRUCTIONS
DP [MFLOP/s] = 1.0E-06*(RETIRED_SSE_AVX_FLOPS_ALL)/time
-
Profiling group to measure (double-precisision) FLOP rate. The event might
have a higher per-cycle increment than 15, so the MERGE event is required. In
contrast to AMD Zen, the Zen2 microarchitecture does not provide events to
differentiate between single- and double-precision.
