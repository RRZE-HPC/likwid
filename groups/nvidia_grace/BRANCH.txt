METRICS
Runtime (RDTSC) [s] time
CPI  PMC1/PMC0
Branch rate   PMC2/PMC0
Branch misprediction rate  PMC3/PMC0
Branch misprediction ratio  PMC3/PMC2
Instructions per branch  PMC0/PMC2

LONG
Formulas:
CPI = CPU_CYCLES/INST_RETIRED
Branch rate = BR_RETIRED/INST_RETIRED
Branch misprediction rate =  BR_MIS_PRED_RETIRED/INST_RETIRED
Branch misprediction ratio = BR_MIS_PRED_RETIRED/BR_RETIRED
Instructions per branch = INSTR_RETIRED_ANY/BR_RETIRED
-
The rates state how often in average a branch or a mispredicted branch occured
per instruction retired in total. The Branch misprediction ratio sets directly
into relation what ratio of all branch instruction where mispredicted.
Instructions per branch is 1/Branch rate.
