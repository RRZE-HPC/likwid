Formulas:
CPI = PM_RUN_CYC / PM_RUN_INST_CMPL
Completion stall cycles = PM_CMPLU_STALL
Stall cycles by thread conflict = PM_CMPLU_STALL_THRD
Stall ratio by thread conflict [%] = PM_CMPLU_STALL_THRD/PM_CMPLU_STALL*100
Stall cycles by d-cache miss = PM_CMPLU_STALL_DCACHE_MISS
Stall ratio by d-cache miss [%] = PM_CMPLU_STALL_DCACHE_MISS/PM_CMPLU_STALL*100
Stall cycles by full castout queue = PM_CMPLU_STALL_COQ_FULL
Stall ratio by full castout queue [%] = PM_CMPLU_STALL_COQ_FULL/PM_CMPLU_STALL*100
