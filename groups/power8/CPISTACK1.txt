First level of IBM CPI stack. IBM names Stalled Cycles, Waiting to Complete,
Thread Blocked, Completion Table Empty, Other and Completion Cycles. For some
there are no clearly identifiable events, so this group concentrates on
Stalled Cycles (PM_CMPLU_STALL), Thread Blocked (PM_CMPLU_STALL_THRD),
Completion Table Empty (PM_GCT_EMPTY_CYC) and Other (PM_CMPLU_STALL_OTHER_CMPL).
