Formulas:
Stall cycles = PM_CMPLU_STALL
Stall cycle ratio = PM_CMPLU_STALL/PM_RUN_CYC
Thread blocked cycles = PM_CMPLU_STALL_THRD
Thread blocked cycle ratio = PM_CMPLU_STALL_THRD/PM_RUN_CYC
GCT empty cycles = PM_GCT_EMPTY_CYC
GCT empty cycle ratio = PM_GCT_EMPTY_CYC/PM_RUN_CYC

First level of IBM CPI stack. IBM names Stalled Cycles, Waiting to Complete,
Thread Blocked, Completion Table Empty, Other and Completion Cycles. For some
there are no clearly identifiable events, so this group concentrates on
Stalled Cycles (PM_CMPLU_STALL), Thread Blocked (PM_CMPLU_STALL_THRD),
Completion Table Empty (PM_GCT_EMPTY_CYC) and Other (PM_CMPLU_STALL_OTHER_CMPL).
