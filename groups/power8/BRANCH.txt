METRICS
Runtime (RDTSC) [s] time
CPI  PMC5/PMC4
Branch rate   (PMC0+PMC1+PMC2)/PMC4
Branch misprediction rate  PMC3/PMC4
Branch misprediction ratio  PMC4/(PMC0+PMC1+PMC2)
Instructions per branch  PMC4/(PMC0+PMC1+PMC2)

LONG
Formulas:
Branch rate = BR_INST_RETIRED_ALL_BRANCHES/INSTR_RETIRED_ANY
Branch misprediction rate =  BR_MISP_RETIRED_ALL_BRANCHES/INSTR_RETIRED_ANY
Branch misprediction ratio = BR_MISP_RETIRED_ALL_BRANCHES/BR_INST_RETIRED_ALL_BRANCHES
Instructions per branch = INSTR_RETIRED_ANY/BR_INST_RETIRED_ALL_BRANCHES
-
The rates state how often in average a branch or a mispredicted branch occured
per instruction retired in total. The Branch misprediction ratio sets directly
into relation what ratio of all branch instruction where mispredicted.
Instructions per branch is 1/Branch rate.
