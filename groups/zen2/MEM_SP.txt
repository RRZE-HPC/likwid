Formulas:
Memory bandwidth [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*(DRAM_CHANNEL_0+DRAM_CHANNEL_1)*(4.0/(num_numadomains/num_sockets))*64.0/runtime
Memory data volume [GBytes] = 1.0E-09*(DRAM_CHANNEL_0+DRAM_CHANNEL_1)*(4.0/(num_numadomains/num_sockets))*64.0
-
Profiling group to measure memory bandwidth drawn by all cores of a socket.
Since this group is based on Uncore events it is only possible to measure on a
per socket base.
The group provides almost accurate results for the total bandwidth
and data volume.
The metric formulas contain a correction factor of (4.0/(num_numadomains/num_sockets)) to
return the value for all 4 memory controllers in NPS1 mode per socket. This is probably
a work-around. Requested info from AMD but no answer.
In contrast to AMD Zen, the Zen2 microarchitecture does not provide events to
differentiate between single- and double-precision.
