Formulas:
L3 request rate = (MEM_LOAD_RETIRED_L3_HIT+MEM_LOAD_RETIRED_L3_MISS)/UOPS_RETIRED_SLOTS
L3 miss rate = MEM_LOAD_RETIRED_L3_MISS/UOPS_RETIRED_SLOTS
L3 miss ratio = MEM_LOAD_RETIRED_L3_MISS/(MEM_LOAD_RETIRED_L3_HIT+MEM_LOAD_RETIRED_L3_MISS)

This group measures the locality of your data accesses with regard to the
L3 cache. L3 request rate tells you how data intensive your code is
or how many data accesses you have on average per instruction.
The L3 miss rate gives a measure how often it was necessary to get
cache lines from memory. And finally L3 miss ratio tells you how many of your
memory references required a cache line to be loaded from a higher level.
While the data cache miss rate might be given by your algorithm you should
try to get data cache miss ratio as low as possible by increasing your cache reuse.
With Intel Icelake, the retired UOPs cannot be measured anymore but instead, it uses the number
of used retirement slots as basis for the rates.
