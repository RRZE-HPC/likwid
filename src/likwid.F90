!! Likwid Fortran90 Module for embedding the Marker API into Fortran applications
!! In the basic configuration the module is compiled with the Intel Fortran Compiler
module likwid

!> \ingroup Fortran_Interface
!! \brief Initialize the Likwid Marker API
!! This routine initializes the Marker API for Fortran. It reads some 
!! environment commonly set by likwid-perfctr.
!! \note Must be called once in a serial region.
  subroutine likwid_markerInit()

!> \ingroup Fortran_Interface
!! \brief Add current thread to Likwid for Marker API measurements
!! This routine adds the current thread to Likwid that it performs measurements
!! for this thread. If using the daemon access mode, it starts a deamon for the
!! current thread.
!! \note  Must be called once in a parallel region.

!> \ingroup Fortran_Interface
!! \brief Setup performance counters for the next event set
!! If multiple groups should be measured this function
!! switches to the next group in a round robin fashion.
!! Each call reprogramms the performance counters for the current CPU,
!! \note Do not call it while measuring a code region.
