Formulas:
Data cache misses = DATA_CACHE_REFILLS_L2_AL + DATA_CACHE_REFILLS_NORTHBRIDGE_ALL
Data cache request rate = DATA_CACHE_ACCESSES / INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED
Data cache miss rate = (DATA_CACHE_REFILLS_L2_AL + DATA_CACHE_REFILLS_NORTHBRIDGE_ALL)/INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED
Data cache miss ratio = (DATA_CACHE_REFILLS_L2_AL + DATA_CACHE_REFILLS_NORTHBRIDGE_ALL)/DATA_CACHE_ACCESSES

This group measures the locality of your data accesses with regard to the
L1 Cache. Data cache request rate tells you how data intensive your code is
or how many Data accesses you have in average per instruction.
The Data cache miss rate gives a measure how often it was necessary to get
cachelines from higher levels of the memory hierarchy. And finally 
Data cache miss ratio tells you how many of your memory references required
a cacheline to be loaded from a higher level. While the Data cache miss rate 
might be given by your algorithm you should try to get Data cache miss ratio
as low as possible by increasing your cache reuse.
This group was taken from the whitepaper -Basic Performance Measurements for AMD Athlon 64,
AMD Opteron and AMD Phenom Processors- from Paul J. Drongowski.
