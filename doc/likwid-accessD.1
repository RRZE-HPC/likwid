.SH NAME
likwid-accessD \- This tool forwards the access operations from LIKWID PerfMon tools
to the MSR  and PCI device files
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B likwid-accessD
is a command line application that opens a UNIX file socket and waits for access
operations from LIKWID tools that require access to the MSR/PCI device
files or MMIO ranges. The MSR/PCI device files and MMIO rangesare only accessible
for users with root privileges, therefore
.B likwid-accessD
requires the suid-bit set or a suitable libcap setting.
Depending on the current system architecture,
.B likwid-accessD
permits only access to registers defined for the architecture.
