<H1>Information</H1>
<CODE>likwid-perfctr</CODE> is a lightweight command line application to configure and read out hardware performance monitoring data
on supported x86 processors. It can measure either as wrapper without changing the measured application
or with \ref Marker_API functions inside the code, which will turn on and off the counters. Moreover, there are the timeline and stethoscope mode.
There are preconfigured performance groups with useful event sets and derived metrics. Additonally, arbitrary events can be measured with
custom event sets. The \ref Marker_API can measure mulitple named regions and the results are accumulated over multiple region calls.
<P>
<B>Note</B> that <CODE>likwid-perfctr</CODE> measures all events on the specified CPUs and not only the context of the executable. On a highly loaded system it will be hard to determine which part of the given application caused the counter increment. Moreover, it is necessary to ensure that processes and threads are pinned to dedicated resources. You can either pin the application yourself or use the builtin pin functionality.

The Marker API for C/C++ offers 6 functions to measure named regions. You can use instrumented code with and without LIKWID. In order to activate the Marker API, <CODE>-DLIKWID_PERFMON</CODE> needs to be added to the compiler call. The following listing describes each function shortly (complete list see \ref Marker_API):
    <UL>
    <LI><CODE>LIKWID_MARKER_INIT</CODE>: Initialize LIKWID globally. Must be called in serial region and only once.</LI>
    <LI><CODE>LIKWID_MARKER_THREADINIT</CODE>: Initialize LIKWID for each thread. Must be called in parallel region and executed by every thread.</LI>
    <LI><CODE>LIKWID_MARKER_START('compute')</CODE>: Start a code region and associate it with the name 'compute'. The names are freely selectable and are used for grouping and outputting regions.</LI>
    <LI><CODE>LIKWID_MARKER_STOP('compute')</CODE>: Stop the code region associated with the name 'compute'.</LI>
    <LI><CODE>LIKWID_MARKER_SWITCH</CODE>: Switches to the next performance group or event set in a round-robin fashion. Can be used to measure the same region with multiple events. If called inside a code region, the results for all groups will be faulty. Be aware that each programming of the config registers causes overhead.</LI>
    <LI><CODE>LIKWID_MARKER_CLOSE</CODE>: Finalize LIKWID globally. Should be called in the end of your application. This writes out all region results to a file that is picked up by <CODE>likwid-perfctr</CODE> for evaluation.</LI>
    </UL>
</LI>

<LI><CODE>likwid-perfctr -c 0-3  -g FLOPS_DP -t 300ms ./a.out 2> out.txt</CODE><BR>
Runs the executable <CODE>a.out</CODE> and measures the performance group <CODE>FLOPS_DP</CODE> on CPUs 0,1,2,3 every 300 ms. Since <CODE>-c</CODE> is used, the application is not pinned to the CPUs and <CODE>OMP_NUM_THREADS</CODE> is not set. The performance group <CODE>FLOPS_DP</CODE> is not available on every architecture, use <CODE>likwid-perfctr -a</CODE> for a complete list. Please note, that <CODE>likwid-perfctr</CODE> writes the measurements to stderr while the application's output and LIKWID's final results are printed to stdout.<BR>
The syntax of the timeline mode output lines is:<BR>
<CODE>&lt;groupID&gt; &lt;numberOfEvents&gt; &lt;numberOfThreads&gt; &lt;Timestamp&gt; &lt;Event1_Thread1&gt; &lt;Event1_Thread2&gt; ... &lt;EventN_ThreadN&gt;</CODE><BR>
You can also use the tool \ref likwid-perfscope to print the measured values live with <CODE>gnuplot</CODE>.
</LI>

<LI><CODE>likwid-perfctr -c 0-3  -g FLOPS_DP -S 2s</CODE><BR>
Measures the performance group <CODE>FLOPS_DP</CODE> on CPUs 0,1,2,3 for 2 seconds. This option can be used to measure application from external or to perform low-level system monitoring.
</LI>

<LI><CODE>likwid-perfctr -c S0:0\@S1:0  -g LLC_LOOKUPS_DATA_READ:CBOX0C0:STATE=0x9 -S 2s</CODE><BR>
Measures the event <CODE> LLC_LOOKUPS_DATA_READ</CODE> on the first CPU of socket 0 and the first CPU on socket 1 for 2 seconds using the counter 0 in CBOX 0 (LLC cache coherency engine). The counting is filtered to only lookups in the 'invalid' and 'modified' state. Look at the microarchitecture Uncore documentation for possible bitmasks. Which option is available for which counter class can be found in section \ref Architectures.
</LI>
</UL>

\anchor performance_groups
<H1>Performance groups</H1>
One of the outstanding features of LIKWID are the performance groups. Each microarchitecture has its own set of events and related counters and finding the suitable events in the documentation is tedious. Moreover, the raw results of the events are often not meaningful, they need to be combined with other events like run time or clock speed. LIKWID addresses those problems by providing performance groups that specify a set of events and counter combinations as well as a set of derived metrics. Starting with LIKWID 4, the performance group definitions are not compiled in anymore, they are read on the fly when they are selected on the commandline. This enables users to define their own performance groups without recompiling and reinstalling LIKWID.<BR>
<B>Please note that performance groups is a feature of the Lua API and not available for the C/C++ API.</B>
<H3>Directory structure</H3>
While installation of LIKWID, the performance groups are copied to the path <CODE>${INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/likwid</CODE>. In this folder there is one subfolder per microarchitecture that contains all performance groups for that microarchitecture. The folder names are not freely selectable, they are defined in <CODE>src/topology.c</CODE>. For every microarchitecture at the time of release, there is already a folder that can be extended with your own performance groups. You can change the path to the performance group directory structure by settings the variable <CODE>likwid.groupfolder</CODE> in your Lua application, the default is <CODE>${INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/likwid</CODE>.
<H3>Syntax of performance group files</H3>
<CODE>SHORT &lt;string&gt;</CODE> // Short description of the performance group<BR>

\anchor Marker_API
<H1>Marker API</H1>
The Marker API enables measurement of user-defined code regions in order to get deeper insight what is happening at a specific point in the application. The Marker API itself has 8 commands. In order to activate the Marker API, the code must be compiled with <CODE>-DLIKWID_PERFMON</CODE>. If the code is compiled without this define, the Marker API functions perform no operation and cause no overhead. You can also run code compiled with LIKWID_PERFMON defined without measurements but a message will be printed.<BR>
Even pure serial applications have to call LIKWID_MARKER_THREADINIT to initialize the accessDaemon or the direct accesses.<BR>
The names for the regions can be freely chosen but <I>whitespaces are not allowed</I>.

</CODE>
The LIKWID package contains an example code: see \ref C-markerAPI-code or \ref F-markerAPI-code.
<H3>Running code</H3>
With the help of <CODE>likwid-perfctr</CODE> the counters are configured to the selected events. The counters are also started and stopped by <CODE>likwid-perfctr</CODE>, the Marker API only reads the counters to minimize the overhead of the instrumented application. Only if you use <CODE>LIKWID_MARKER_SWITCH</CODE> the Marker API itself configures a new event set to the registers. Basically, <CODE>likwid-perfctr</CODE> exports the whole configuration needed by the Marker API through environment variables that are evaluated during <CODE>LIKWID_MARKER_INIT</CODE>. In the end, <CODE>likwid-perfctr</CODE> picks up the file with the results of the Marker API run and prints out the performance results.<BR>
In order to build your instrumented application:<BR>
<CODE>$CC -openmp -L&lt;PATH_TO_LIKWID_LIBRARY&gt; -I&lt;PATH_TO_LIKWID_INCLUDES&gt; &lt;SRC_CODE&gt; -o &lt;EXECUTABLE&gt; -llikwid</CODE><BR>
With standard installation, the paths are <CODE>&lt;PATH_TO_LIKWID_LIBRARY&gt;=/usr/local/lib</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;PATH_TO_LIKWID_INCLUDES&gt;=/usr/local/include</CODE><BR>
Example Marker API call:<BR>
<CODE>likwid-perfctr -C 0-4 -g L3 <B>-m</B> ./a.out</CODE>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2>Fortran Code</H2>
Besides the Marker API for C/C++ programms, LIKWID offers to build a Fortran module to access the Marker API functions from Fortran. Only the Marker API calls are exported, not the whole API. In <CODE>config.mk</CODE> the variable <CODE>FORTRAN_INTERFACE</CODE> must be set to true. LIKWID's default is to use the Intel Fortran compiler to build the interface but it can be modified to use GCC's Fortran compiler in <CODE>make/include_&lt;COMPILER&gt;</CODE>.<BR>
The LIKWID package contains an example code: see \ref F-markerAPI-code.

<H2>Hints for the usage of the Marker API</H2>
Since the calls to the LIKWID library are executed by your application, the runtime will raise and in specific circumstances, there are some other problems like the time measurement. You can execute <CODE>LIKWID_MARKER_THREADINIT</CODE> and <CODE>LIKWID_MARKER_START</CODE> inside the same parallel region but put a barrier between the calls to ensure that there is no big timing difference between the threads. The common way is to init LIKWID and the participating threads inside of an initialization routine, use only START and STOP in your code and close the Marker API in a finalization routine. Be aware that at the first start of a region, the thread-local hash table gets a new entry to store the measured values. If your code inside the region is short or you are executing the region only once, the overhead of creating the hash table entry can be significant compared to the execution of the region code. The overhead of creating the hash tables can be done in prior by using the <CODE>LIKWID_MARKER_REGISTER</CODE> function. It must be called by each thread and one time for each compute region. It is completely <I>optional</I>, <CODE>LIKWID_MARKER_START</CODE> performs the same operations.

<H2>CUDA code</H2>
With LIKWID 5.0 CUDA kernels can be measured. There is a special NvMarkerAPI for Nvidia GPUs. The usage is similar to the CPU MarkerAPI, just replace <CODE>LIKWID_MARKER_</CODE> with <CODE>LIKWID_NVMARKER_</CODE>. All MarkerAPIs can be mixed.

<H2>ROCm code</H2>
ROCm kernels can be measured. There is a special RocmonMarkerAPI for AMD GPUs. The usage is similar to the CPU or Nvidia MarkerAPI, just replace <CODE>LIKWID_MARKER_</CODE> with <CODE>ROCMON_MARKER_</CODE>. All MarkerAPIs can be mixed.
