.SH DESCRIPTION
.B likwid-setFrequencies
is a command line application to set the clock frequency of CPU cores. Since only priviledged users are allowed to change the frequency of CPU cores, the application works in combination with a daemon
.B likwid-setFreq(1).
The daemon needs the suid permission bit to be set in order to manipulate the sysfs entries. With
.B likwid-setFrequencies
the clock of all cores inside a the cpu_list or affinity domain can be set to a specific frequency or governor at once.
.B likwid-setFrequencies
works only with the kernel module
.B acpi-cpufreq.
The recent
.B intel_pstate
module does not allow to set fixed frequencies. In order to deactivate
.B intel_pstate
add 'intel_pstate=disable' to your kernel boot commandline (commonly in grub) and load the
.B acpi-cpufreq
module.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
prints a help message to standard output, then exits.
.TP
.B \-p
prints the current frequencies for all CPU cores
.TP
.B \-l
prints all configurable frequencies
.TP
.B \-m
prints all configurable governors
.TP
.B \-\^c <cpu_list>
set the affinity domain where to set the frequencies. Common are N (Node), SX (Socket X), CX (Cache Group X) and MX (Memory Group X).
For detailed information about affinity domains see
.B likwid-pin(1)
.TP
.B \-\^g <governor>
set the governor of all CPU cores inside the affinity domain. Current governors are ondemand, performance, turbo. Default is ondemand
.TP
.B \-\^f, \-\-\^freq <frequency>
set a fixed frequency at all CPU cores inside the affinity domain. Implicitly sets userspace governor for the cores.
.TP
.B \-\^x, \-\-\^min <min_freq>
set a fixed minimal frequency at all CPU cores inside the affinity domain. Can be used in combination with a dynamic governor.
.TP
.B \-\^y, \-\-\^max <max_freq>
set a fixed maximal frequency at all CPU cores inside the affinity domain. Can be used in combination with a dynamic governor.
.TP
.B \-\^t, \-\-\^turbo <0|1>
deactivates/activates Turbo mode for the specified CPU cores.
.TP
.B \-\-\^umin <uncore_min_freq>
set the minimal frequency for the uncore. There are no limits available, but
.B likwid-setFrequencies
allows the available minimal CPU frequency as minimal Uncore frequency.
.TP
.B \-\-\^umax <uncore_max_freq>
set the maximal frequency for the uncore. There are no limits available, but
.B likwid-setFrequencies
allows the available maximal CPU frequency (with a single core and Turbo) as maximal Uncore frequency.
.TP
.B \-\-\^reset
resets the CPU cores to maximal range, deactivates Turbo mode and sets the
governor to "performance", "conservative" or the last one in the governor list
as fallback
.TP
.B \-\-\^ureset
resets the Uncore to maximal range. It uses the minimally available CPU
frequency as minimal Uncore frequency and the maximally achievable CPU frequency
(single core, Turbo active) as maximal Uncore frequency.
